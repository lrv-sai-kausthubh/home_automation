# home_automation
this is the code for home automation website to conrol a esp32 remotely


right now for the bakckend logic i am using json bin.
what it does it
the website checks if there is any update in the buttons & updates the json bin and the esp32 accesses the json bin & detects the changes and turn on/off lights accordingly.
